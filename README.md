## Dependencies

Python ≥ 3.10, `numpy ≥ 1.24`, `sympy ≥ 1.12`.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
source .venv/bin/activate       # Linux / macOS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Reproducing the paper

All scripts under `scripts/` are standalone (stdlib + numpy + sympy).
Each script contains its own inlined Jacobson–Matthews sampler or
exhaustive enumerator as appropriate.  Typical usage:

```bash
python scripts/jm_paper_verify.py           # ≈ 1 min, covers the main claims
python scripts/sandpile_n6_exhaustive.py    # ≈ 1–2 s, n=6 census
python scripts/verify_n8_jm.py              # ≈ 5–10 s, n=8 sharpness witness
python scripts/jm_sharp_bound.py            # ≈ 1–2 min, full sharpness sweep
python scripts/red_team_verify.py           # adversarial re-run
```

The empirical frequencies quoted in the paper
(e.g. “≈11% of Jacobson–Matthews samples at n=8 satisfy
32 ∣ det E_std but 64 ∤ det E_std”, “347 samples with dim ker = 1
across n=8, 12, 16”, “73% conditional frequency”, “2 700 samples
across n ≤ 20”) are direct outputs of these scripts; re-running
them under the seeds printed in the script headers reproduces the
figures up to statistical noise.

## Key paper results

- **Theorem (unified divisibility)**: `n² / gcd(n,2) | det(E_std)` for every Latin square, every n ≥ 2.
- **Theorem (F₂-rank criterion, n ≡ 2 mod 4)**: `n² | det(E_std) ⇔ rank_{F₂}(A mod 2) < n − 1`.
- **Theorem (adjugate criterion, n ≡ 0 mod 4)**: `n² | det(E_std) ⇔ adj(A mod 2) · 𝟏 = 0 over F₂`.
- **Proposition (n=6 census)**: of 9 408 reduced Latin squares, 8 832 satisfy `36 | det(E_std)` and 576 have the anomalous 18-divisible class.
- **Universal counterexamples**: an explicit infinite family of skip-one circulant parity patterns yields counterexamples to `n² | det(E_std)` for every n ≡ 2 mod 4, n ≥ 6.

## Claim Boundary

Companion claim-discipline docs were added on 2026-07-08 (after the
`v1.0-submission` tag; the paper is unchanged):

- `CLAIM_LEDGER.md` — every claim with its level (theorem-in-paper,
  certified-finite, evidence, blocked/resolved) and paper locator.
- `PUBLIC_CLAIM_BOUNDARY.md` — what may and may not be quoted from this work.
- `README_REVIEWER.md` — 10/30-minute reviewer paths.
- `REPRODUCE.md` — verified smoke replay (n=6 exhaustive census),
  long-tier sampling runs, and the certified package map.

Short form: the three theorems and the counterexample family are proved in
the paper; the n=6 census is exhaustive and replayable; p-adic bound
TIGHTNESS and all sampling tables are evidence, not proof. The curated
certified-dataset package described in the paper's availability paragraph
was built 2026-07-09 (`results/certified/` with SHA256SUMS manifest; item
map in `REPRODUCE.md`) with four documented deviations from the
paragraph's wording — seed attribution, regenerated n=8 corpus, package
layout, p-adic scan range — recorded in `CLAIM_LEDGER.md`, GAP-1.
